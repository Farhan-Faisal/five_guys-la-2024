Banksy is a pseudonymous street artist, political activist, and film director based in England, whose real name and identity remain unconfirmed. He has been active since the 1990s, gaining international recognition for his satirical street art. Banksy's work combines dark humor and social commentary, created using a distinct stenciling technique. His art has appeared on streets, walls, and bridges across the world. Rooted in the Bristol underground scene, Banksy was influenced by collaborations between musicians and artists, notably citing 3D, a member of Massive Attack, as an inspiration.

Banksy’s identity has long been a mystery, leading to ongoing speculation. Some believe he is Robin Gunningham from Yate, while others speculate that he could be Robert Del Naja of Massive Attack. In 2020, rumors falsely claimed that TV presenter Neil Buchanan was Banksy. Banksy has emphasized the importance of anonymity, partly because graffiti is illegal, making secrecy vital to his career.

Banksy began his career in the early 1990s as part of the DryBreadZ Crew in Bristol. His early works were freehand graffiti, but he switched to stenciling in the late 1990s for faster execution. His first large mural, The Mild Mild West (1997), depicted a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at riot police. This mural helped Banksy gain wider recognition. His stencils are known for combining powerful imagery with slogans that critique war, capitalism, and authority.

In the early 2000s, Banksy's art began to reach international audiences. He held exhibitions in Los Angeles and London, such as Existencilism in 2002 and Turf War in 2003. In 2005, Banksy created art on the Israeli West Bank barrier, drawing attention to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His works feature recurring characters like rats, children, and policemen, and his messages often critique political and societal issues, such as consumerism and war.

By the mid-2000s, Banksy had achieved commercial success. His works, like Bombing Middle England and Girl with Balloon, fetched record prices at auctions. This commercial success led to the term "Banksy effect," referring to the growing interest in street art that his popularity generated. Despite his success, Banksy often mocks the commercialization of art, famously posting a picture on his website with the caption, “I can’t believe you morons actually buy this shit.”

In 2010, Banksy released the documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was later nominated for an Academy Award. The film explores the commercialization of street art, blurring the lines between art and commerce. Banksy continued creating new works during this period, including a series of politically charged street art pieces in Los Angeles leading up to the Oscars.

In 2015, Banksy opened Dismaland, a satirical “bemusement park” that critiqued consumer culture and environmental destruction. He also established The Walled Off Hotel in Bethlehem, overlooking the Israeli West Bank barrier. This provocative project was designed to comment on the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 2018, Banksy staged one of his most famous pranks when his artwork Girl with Balloon self-destructed by shredding itself after being sold for £1 million at Sotheby’s auction.

Throughout his career, Banksy has used his art to support various causes. He has donated artworks to raise funds for campaigns like the European migrant crisis and anti-arms trade initiatives. In 2020, he funded a rescue boat to help refugees in the Mediterranean Sea. His artwork Game Changer, which honored NHS workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, sold for £14.4 million, with proceeds going to health-related charities.

Despite his anonymity, Banksy's work has had a significant impact on the global art scene. His politically charged street art continues to challenge authority and provoke discussion on issues such as capitalism, war, and social injustice. He remains one of the most influential and controversial artists of the modern era.
